<h4>Updates on Greg's WordPress Plugins</h4>

<p>Please also see the README file distributed with this plugin and the plugin page at:  <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/02/16/show-total-conversations/">Greg's Show Total Conversations plugin</a>.</p>


<p>On the main settings page, just enable the option to show the discussions number automatically on any of four different types of pages, and it will be inserted into the text displayed by the built-in WordPress function <code>comments_number()</code>.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can switch off the automatic option and instead show the number manually wherever you would like by calling the following function, preferably wrapped in a conditional that tests whether the function exists:</p>

<p><code>gstc_show_discussions_number_manually()</code></p>

<p>For any given type of page, the plugin will display the conversation count <em>either</em> automatically <em>or</em> manually, but not both. If enabled in your settings, automatic display will take prececedence. This means you can test placements in your theme by just turning the automatic option on and off, without having to add and delete the call from your theme repeatedly.</p>

<p>For details on how to wrap functions in conditionals so your theme will only rely on this plugin when it is activated, please see the announcement page for one of my other plugins at: <a href="http://counsellingresource.com/features/2009/01/27/threaded-comment-numbering-plugin-for-wordpress/">Greg's Threaded Comment Numbering plugin</a>.</p>
