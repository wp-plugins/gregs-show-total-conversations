header[] = Inserting the Discussions Number
preface[] = "Greg's Show Total Conversations plugin can automatically insert the number of threaded discussions wherever the <code>comments_number()</code> function appears within your theme or your admin pages. Alternatively, you can place the number manually and specify the text around it by calling the <code>gstc_show_discussions_number_manually()</code> function directly. For any given type of page, the plugin won't try to do both at once -- so if you include a manual function call in your theme but have <em>also</em> told the plugin to display automatically on that type of page, it will only display automatically. This means you can test placements in your theme by just turning the automatic option on and off, without having to add and delete the call from your theme repeatedly."

header[] = How the Discussions Number Will Be Shown
preface[] = "You can specify the text that will accompany the discussions number in exactly the same way as you can with the built-in <code>comments_number()</code> function. If you'd like a leading space before any of your text -- for example to ensure the discussions number is separated on the left from your normal comments number -- use the code for a non-breaking space, <code>%nbsp%</code>, to indicate a space. This will overcome a limitation in the way WordPress versions 2.7 and later process admin page text option fields."
